abstract = {Web-based applications are highly accessible to users, providing rich, interactive content while eliminating the need to install software locally. However, evolutionary robotics (ER) has faced challenges in this domain as web-based technologies have not been amenable to 3D physics simulations. Traditionally, physics-based simulations require a local installation and a high degree of user knowledge to configure an environment, but the emergence of Javascript-based physics engines enables complex simulations to be executed in web browsers. These developments create opportunities for ER research to reach new audiences by increasing accessibility. In this work, we introduce two web-based tools we have built to facilitate the exchange of ideas with other researchers as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public. The first tool is intended to distribute and exchange ER research results, while the second is a completely browser-based implementation of an ER environment.},

abstract = {Abstract In this report, we review the current state of the art of web‐based visualization applications. Recently, an increasing number of web‐based visualization applications have emerged. This is due to the fact that new technologies offered by modern browsers greatly increased the capabilities for visualizations on the web. We first review these technical aspects that are enabling this development. This includes not only improvements for local rendering like WebGL and HTML5, but also infrastructures like grid or cloud computing platforms. Another important factor is the transfer of data between the server and the client. Therefore, we also discuss advances in this field, for example methods to reduce bandwidth requirements like compression and other optimizations such as progressive rendering and streaming. After establishing these technical foundations, we review existing web‐based visualization applications and prototypes from various application domains. Furthermore, we propose a classification of these web‐based applications based on the technologies and algorithms they employ. Finally, we also discuss promising application areas that would benefit from web‐based visualization and assess their feasibility based on the existing approaches.}

abstract = {Animal movements are realized by a combination of high-level control from the nervous system and joint-level movement provided by the musculoskeletal system. The digital muscle model (DMM) emulates the low-level musculoskeletal system and can be combined with a high-level artificial neural network (ANN) controller forming a hybrid control strategy. Previous work has shown that, compared to ANN-only controllers, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit similar performance with fewer synapses, suggesting that some computation is offloaded to the low-level DMM. An open question is how the complexity of the robot, in terms of the number of joints, affects the evolution of the ANN control structure. We explore this question by evolving both hybrid controllers and ANN-only controllers for worm-like animats of varying complexity. Specifically, the number of joints in the worms ranges from 1 to 12. Consistent with an earlier study, the results demonstrate that, in most cases, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit equal or better performance than ANN-only controllers. In addition, above a threshold for animat complexity (number of joints), the ANNs for one variant of the hybrid controllers have significantly fewer connections than the ANN-only controllers.},
