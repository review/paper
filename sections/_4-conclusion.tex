\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we have presented Review, a web-based tool for sharing evolutionary robotics visualizations with collaborators and other researchers.
%
The interactive visualizations enabled by Review are complementary to current techniques such as providing image sequences and links to videos.
%
Moreover, the simple log file format and export to glTF feature will enable researchers to import their simulation results into 3D author tools such as Maya, which will enable the production of high-quality videos more suitable for presentations.
%
In the future, we anticipate adding the following features: (1) the ability to import more than one animation at a time so that researchers can compare the results from different trials in the same view, (2) support for additional mesh and material formats, and (3) the ability to generate videos.
